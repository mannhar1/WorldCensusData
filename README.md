# WorldCensusData
This project takes in data from 2 txt files, 1 to list which countries are in which continents, and the other to list data about the countries.  Then we determine which of the countries in each continent fit certain criteria, such as the highest literacy rate, or the highest population.  And this data is displayed to the console.  A Makefile is also supplied.
